# What to do?

## Smart Contract

* See if the current wallet is part of any multisig wallet created from our smart contract (ex : isInMultisig(address))
* create certificate function to route the call to multisig for nft certificate creation.
* create 3 not working with matic testnet


## UI

* Only show issue page if the current account is in multisig.
* multisig dashboard - list pending transactions, how many confirmations left, button for aprove/ reject, Execute button (if full confirmation is there)
